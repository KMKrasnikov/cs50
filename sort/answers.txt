sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: When I started sort sorted50000 this algoritm was faster than sort3. Bubble sort has omega(n) it's faster than omega(n^2)

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: When I started sort random50000 this algoritm was the fastest. Merge sort has O(n log n) it's faster than O(n^2)

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: When I started sort sorted50000 this algoritm was slower than sort1. Selection sort has omega(n^2) it's slower than omega(n)
